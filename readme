Extract transaction from the Solana blockchain.

## Usage

1. Ensure Python 3.11+ is available (the script uses only the standard library).
2. Run the fetcher against the provided address list:

   ```bash
   python solscan_fetch.py --input solana.csv --output transactions.json --limit 50
   ```

   Use `--limit` to control how many transactions to request per address and `--delay` to throttle requests.

3. To use your own Solscan token or a different API URL, set environment variables:

   ```bash
   SOLSCAN_API_KEY="<your-token>" SOLSCAN_API_URL="https://pro-api.solscan.io/v2" python solscan_fetch.py
   ```

Results are written to `transactions.json` as a JSON object keyed by address.
